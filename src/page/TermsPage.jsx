            People are different. So, we offer you different types of accounts and
            features to help you create, share, grow your presence and communicate
            with people on and off Instagram. We also want to strengthen your
            relationships through shared experiences that you actually care about. So
            we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care
            about, and use that information to help you create, find, join and share
            in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content,
            features, offers and accounts that you might be interested in, and
            offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things that you
            and others do on and off Instagram.
